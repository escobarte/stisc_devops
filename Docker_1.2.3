docker run --name Prx01 nginx -d(ditach) -p(port mapping) 8080:80
docker ps
#now you can access your ip addr with port 8080 and will see welcome for nginx
ps -ef | grep nginx (container is a process running from a directory)
cd /var/lib/docker/
# if you to do some command in you docker container
docker exec Prx01 ls /
#it is like simple ls / being on this server
docker exec -it Prx01 /bin/bash #now you are in the container
